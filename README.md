# 🚀 GeoServer Exploit for CVE-2024-36401 🚀


## 📝 Description

**GeoServer** is an open-source Java-based software server that enables users to view, edit, and share geospatial data. It offers a versatile and efficient solution for distributing geospatial information from various sources such as GIS databases, web-based data, and personal datasets.

In versions of GeoServer earlier than **2.23.2**, **2.23.6**, versions **2.24.0** to **2.24.3**, and version **2.25.0**, there exists a vulnerability (**CVE-2024-36401**) that permits Remote Code Execution (RCE) by unauthenticated users. This issue arises from the unsafe evaluation of property names as XPath expressions in multiple OGC request parameters.

Exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can send a POST request containing a malicious XPath expression, which can result in arbitrary command execution as root on the system running GeoServer.
